        <h3>Challenge</h3>
        <p>Our team set out to find a nonprofit organization with a website in need of improvement—one that could benefit from a more user-centered, modern design.
          <br><br>
          The Riverside Art Center’s existing site was outdated, hard to navigate, and didn’t effectively support its mission. Users struggled to find key information, and the overall experience felt cluttered and uninviting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-6">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>We rebuilt the website with a strong focus on UX, aligning it with Riverside Art Center’s mission to promote fine arts in the Wapakoneta area. The layout is now cleaner, easier to navigate, and more engaging for users. 
        <br> <br>
        We also made the site fully responsive for mobile devices, helping the center reach more people and further supporting the organization’s goal.</p>

        <p>The redesign of the Riverside Art Center website will enhance its ability to fulfill its core mission of promoting fine arts in the greater Wapakoneta area. The current website faces challenges in terms of user navigation, accessibility, and engagement. Which limits the effectiveness and reach to key target audiences such as donors, volunteers, and users in general.</p>

        <p>After conducting research on the Riverside Art Center and its mission, we developed a user persona to help guide our design decisions. This persona represents one of the key user types likely to visit the site and engage with its offerings.
          <br><br>
          This persona helped us keep the user experience grounded in empathy. It influenced decisions such as simplifying navigation, prioritizing community content, and improving accessibility across devices.

        <p>To better understand the user's experience, we created a journey map based on our persona, Kate Maskson—a stay-at-home mom seeking creative fulfillment and community      connection. In her journey, Kate searches for local art classes and finds the Riverside Art Center website through Google. As she explores the homepage, she reads about RAC’s mission, browses through artists and class listings, and selects one to attend. Her positive experience at the class, along with meeting like-minded individuals, leads her to learn more about RAC, donate to the organization, and eventually become a member. This journey highlights the importance of clear navigation, engaging content, and a streamlined donation process in fostering user trust and long-term involvement.</p>

      <h3 class="">Content Hierarchy</h3>
      <p>The content hierarchy on the homepage makes it challenging to quickly identify the most important information. Key elements, like the hero and body sections, are poorly organized, making it difficult for users to distinguish between different areas of the site.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Grouping:</strong> Related content is not consistently grouped, which leads to user confusion and disrupts the flow of navigation.</li>
        <li><strong>Call-to-Actions (CTAs):</strong> The CTAs feel underwhelming and lack prominence, reducing their effectiveness in driving user engagement.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h5 class="mt-4">Recommended Improvements:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>Clearly differentiate sections to create a more structured layout.</li>
        <li>Group related content, such as all calls to action, into well-defined sections to streamline the user experience and improve clarity.</li>

        <p>We analyzed the site’s content hierarchy through color usage, scale, and grouping. While the bright colors and varied text sizes draw attention, inconsistent use and lack of structure make it hard for users to navigate. Grouping was also inconsistent, leading to confusion about related content. To improve clarity, we recommended refining the color palette, increasing and standardizing font sizes, and organizing similar content into clearly defined sections.</p>

From this audit, we pinpointed areas that needed improved organization, clearer messaging, and better alignment with user needs and business goals.</p>

        <h3 class="">Brand Voice Guide</h3>
        <p>To ensure consistency across all communications, we created a Brand Voice Guide that outlines how Riverside Art Center should sound and present itself. We identified four key traits—Cooperative, Imaginative, Innovative, and Humble—and clarified how each one should be reflected in tone and messaging.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Cooperative:</strong> The voice should foster collaboration, build community, and encourage participation. It should never come across as disorganized or dismissive of individual contributions.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Imaginative:</strong> Creativity is central to the brand, especially in providing unique teaching and art experiences. The tone should feel curious and expressive—without sacrificing purpose or inclusivity.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Innovative:</strong> Messaging should highlight the center’s leadership and fresh ideas in the local arts space, offering value through resources that are distinctive and difficult to replicate.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Humble:</strong> Communication should be approachable and community-focused, prioritizing shared success over self-promotion, while still showing confidence and value.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This guide became an essential tool for crafting content—from headlines to CTAs—and helped shape a voice that feels both artistic and grounded in community.</p>

        <h3 class="">Brand Prism</h3>
        <p>To clearly define Riverside Art Center’s brand, we developed a Brand Identity Prism. This framework helped us break down the brand’s personality and how it should be perceived by users.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Physique:</strong> Artistic visuals, vibrant colors, and a welcoming presence.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Personality:</strong> Imaginative, humble, supportive, and community-driven—building trust through authentic engagement.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Culture:</strong> A nurturing environment where creativity thrives, encouraging inspiration and self-expression.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Relationship:</strong> Fosters meaningful connections with users through trust, support, and shared artistic values.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Reflection:</strong> Speaks to individuals who are passionate, creative, and eager to grow and collaborate with others.</li>

Dropdown menus under key sections like "Classes" and "Events" allow users to quickly explore related content, while the tertiary navigation places high-priority calls to action—“Become A Member” and “Donate”—in prominent buttons for maximum visibility. A clean footer provides quick access to essential links, reinforcing trust and usability across the site.</p>

        <p> If we increase the spacing between the redesigned cards and add margin to the columns, then the layout will appear cleaner and easier to navigate, improving user engagement. Additionally, redesigning the navigation will make it more intuitive, reducing the time it takes for users to find key information.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-2"> Proper spacing enhances readability, especially on smaller mobile screens, ensuring users can easily distinguish between different sections.</li>

        <h3 class="">Mobile prototype Variations</h3>
        <p>To evaluate how different design approaches would impact user experience, we created two versions of our mobile prototype.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Version A:</strong> featured our initial layout, with standard spacing, navigation, and card structure.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Version B:</strong> introduced more generous spacing, a simplified navigation system, and improved card hierarchy to highlight key content.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These variations allowed us to explore how layout and structure might influence readability and ease of use. The next step was to gather user feedback to determine which direction to move forward with.</p>

          <li class="py-2">Users found Design A more intuitive and easier to navigate.</li>
          <li class="py-2">Feedback pointed to minor adjustments needed on the Membership page for improved clarity.</li>
          <li class="py-2">Several users suggested moving social media links to the bottom of the page to reduce visual clutter.</li>
          <li class="py-2">One key insight was the recommendation to align artist images consistently on the Our Artists page, which we later implemented for better balance.</li>

        <h3 class=""> Style Guide</h3>
        <p>Our style guide focused on creating a clean, high-contrast design that keeps the spotlight on the art and artists.</p>
        <ul>
          <li class="py-2"> <strong>Colors:</strong> We used a neutral base of black and white, complemented by soft blue, pale yellow, and light gray gradients. These subtle accents add warmth without overwhelming the content.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Typography:</strong> We paired ‘Sequel Sans’ and ‘Inter’ for readability, with ‘Neue Haas Grotesk’ bold for strong, clear headings.</li>
          <li class="py-2"><strong>Imagery:</strong> A mix of artwork and artist photos brings personality and authenticity to the site. While some images are stock-based, they serve as visual guidance for future high-quality sourcing.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This guide helped us shape a site that’s inviting, accessible, and aligned with the nonprofit’s mission.</p>

          <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
          <p>The Riverside Art Center project stands out as one of the most meaningful and transformative experiences in my UX/UI journey. It challenged me to step up as a leader—guiding my team, staying organized, and making sure we stayed aligned throughout the process. This project helped sharpen my leadership, strengthened my ability to build clear information architecture, and deepened my problem-solving skills. <br> <br> It also boosted my confidence as a designer. I now find myself analyzing websites with a much more critical and insightful eye, spotting usability issues and understanding how to improve them. This project didn’t just test my skills—it elevated them. I’m proud of how far I’ve come and excited to apply everything I’ve learned to future challenges.</p>
